Now you have to study the topic of a self-correcting message on the example of Hamming codes. Sadly, but no, you don't have to yet. Let's leave it for the next time.

For now let's take another look at that sequence:

0x1c0x2d0x3e(0x4c *suddenly*)

** hex -> **

yields:

.->L

As you can easily guess, a point at the beginning can represent coordinates. Probably discrete set of known data points. (Looking ahead, I'll clarify that this is a witch of Agnesi curve)
y = (a^3)/(a^2 + x^2), a = 3 (Number of days between our birthdays)

Set of data points:
  x    f(x)
-10    0.25
-5     0.8
 0      3
 5     0.8
 10    0.25

But what does this letter 'L' stand for this time?
.->Lagrange polynomial

You should get Interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form using this set of points of the above-mentioned curve.

After you get a polynomial, you should calculate f(x), x = (3 2003 2000) = 320032000

You should get negative number.

Than you can get IV for the AES-128 converting this number to hex.
Now it remains to get the key and it will be possible to decrypt the message.
